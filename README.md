## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook and 3 json data available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
